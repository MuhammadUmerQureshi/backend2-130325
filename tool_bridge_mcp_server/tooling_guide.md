## Overview

The Location Intelligence Platform uses a **7-tool architecture** that provides comprehensive business analysis capabilities for Saudi Arabia. Each tool is specialized for specific analysis types while working together seamlessly through data handles.

### Architecture Principles
- **Single Data Fetcher**: One universal tool for all geospatial data acquisition
- **Specialized Analyzers**: Six focused tools for different analysis types
- **Handle-Based Communication**: Tools pass lightweight references instead of raw data
- **Saudi-Specific Intelligence**: All tools optimized for Saudi Arabian market conditions
- **Modular Workflows**: AI Agent selects appropriate tools based on query complexity

### Updated Tool Discovery for AI Agent

```python
# AI Agent discovers tools and understands the complete workflow:

üß† AI Agent Learning:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "fetch_geospatial_data" ‚Üí "I can get any Saudi geographic data as GeoJSON"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "analyze_market_intelligence" ‚Üí "I can analyze demographics and competition"  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "optimize_site_selection" ‚Üí "I can rank and score potential locations"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "calculate_route_coverage" ‚Üí "I can optimize logistics and delivery routes"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "assess_financial_viability" ‚Üí "I can project ROI and financial returns"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "assess_business_risks" ‚Üí "I can identify and mitigate business risks"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "generate_implementation_roadmap" ‚Üí "I can create actionable project plans"

üéØ Workflow Intelligence:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ For market analysis ‚Üí Use tools 1, 2, 3
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ For site selection ‚Üí Use tools 1, 2, 3, 4
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ For business planning ‚Üí Use all 7 tools in sequence
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ For quick location query ‚Üí Use tools 1, 3 only
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ For comprehensive report ‚Üí Full 9-step orchestration
```

This architecture gives you:
- ‚úÖ **One unified data fetcher** that always returns GeoJSON + handles
- ‚úÖ **6 specialized analysis tools** for comprehensive business intelligence
- ‚úÖ **Modular workflow** - AI Agent uses what it needs for each query
- ‚úÖ **Complete report generation** capability matching your example
- ‚úÖ **Saudi-specific intelligence** built into every tool
- ‚úÖ **Lightweight context** through data handle architecture

The AI Agent can now autonomously generate sophisticated logistics analysis reports by orchestrating these tools based on user requirements!
